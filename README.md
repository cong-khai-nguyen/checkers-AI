# Description
In this project, I design the game checker in Python using Pygame. For the AI part of the game, I implement the minimax algorithm, which look at all its possible moves and its opponent's moves in response to its moves. At each turn, the AI evaluate its move with this formula: # white_left - # red_left + (# white_king * 0.5 - # red_king * 0.5). AI(white checker piece) will want to maximize the white related values and while minizing the red related values.
